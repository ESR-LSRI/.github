## Lakeside Summer Research Institute


The Lakeside Summer Research Institute (LSRI) is a four-week summer research experience in which students
engage in mentored research projects with tangible, externally-visible outcomes (e.g., educational blog posts,
presentations at regional and national conferences, peer-reviewed publications). This year, 2023, the LSRI 
will be focused on three topics:

* The Antarctic Ice and Climate

* The Weather and Climate of Mount Baker, and

* Paleoclimate Studies in Greenland.

Students will be mentored in a supportive and inclusive learning environment by scientists and educators from
Earth and Space Research (www.esr.org), a Seattle-based non-profit research institute. Students will be exposed to
a mixture of state-of-the-art data analysis techniques, satellite data (e.g., surface height measurements and visible
images), and other weather, ocean, and ice data products.
