The Lakeside Summer Research Institute is a four-week summer research experience in which students engage in mentored research projects with tangible, externally-visible outcomes (e.g., educational blog posts, presentations at regional and national conferences, peer-reviewed publications) on Lakeside campus. This year, the LSRI will be focused on three topics: 
	1. Antarctic Ice Sheet, Ice Shelves, and Climate
  2. Antarctic Sea ice and Climate
	2. the Weather and Climate of Mount Baker, 
	3. Paleoclimate Studies in Greenland. 

Students will be mentored by scientists from Earth and Space Research (ESR, www.esr.org), a Seattle-based non-profit research institute. Students will be exposed to a mixture of state-of-the-art data analysis techniques, satellite data (e.g. ICESat-2, AMSR2), and other weather and climate data products (e.g. ERA5). They will interact with other professional scientists at Earth and Space Research and the University of Washington.
